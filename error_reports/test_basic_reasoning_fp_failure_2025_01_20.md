# PyReason Functional Test Failure - Error Report

**Date:** January 20, 2025
**Issue:** AssertionError in `test_basic_reasoning_fp` functional test
**Severity:** Medium (affects both FP and regular versions - not FP-specific)
**Status:** üîç ANALYZED - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Issue affects both interpretation types

---

## 1. Test Failure Analysis

### Test Case
```
tests/functional/test_pyreason_comprehensive.py::TestFixedPointVersions::test_basic_reasoning_fp
```

### Failure Symptoms
- ‚ùå Test **fails** with `AssertionError: Should infer connected(A, C) via transitivity`
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Regular version **also fails** with same transitive rule
- Error occurs at line 421: `assert interpretation.query(pr.Query('connected(A, C)'))`
- **Issue is fundamental** to PyReason's handling of all-edge transitive rules, not FP-specific

### Error Details
```
AssertionError: Should infer connected(A, C) via transitivity
File "tests/functional/test_pyreason_comprehensive.py", line 421, in test_basic_reasoning_fp
    assert interpretation.query(pr.Query('connected(A, C)')), 'Should infer connected(A, C) via transitivity'
```

### Root Cause Investigation
- Test performs transitive reasoning: `connected(x, z) <-1 connected(x, y), connected(y, z)`
- Given facts: `connected(A, B)` and `connected(B, C)`
- Expected inference: `connected(A, C)` via transitivity
- **Both FP and regular versions fail** to make this inference

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The problem stems from FP rule grounding logic not properly converting valid groundings into applicable rules:

### Test Logic Flow
```python
# Setup: Simple transitive reasoning scenario
graph = nx.DiGraph()
graph.add_edge("A", "B")
graph.add_edge("B", "C")

# Rule: Transitivity
pr.add_rule(pr.Rule('connected(x, z) <-1 connected(x, y), connected(y, z)', 'transitive_rule'))

# Facts: Direct connections
pr.add_fact(pr.Fact('connected(A, B)', 'fact1'))
pr.add_fact(pr.Fact('connected(B, C)', 'fact2'))

# Expected: connected(A, C) should be inferred
interpretation = pr.reason(timesteps=2)
assert interpretation.query(pr.Query('connected(A, C)'))  # ‚Üê Fails
```

### Reasoning Timeline Expected
| Step | Available Facts | Rule Application | Expected Result |
|------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Initial | `connected(A,B)`, `connected(B,C)` | - | Base facts established |
| T=0 | Same + rule grounding | Apply transitive rule | Infer `connected(A,C)` |
| Final | All three connections | - | Query `connected(A,C)` succeeds |

### Comparison with Regular Version
| Component | Regular Interpretation | FP Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Fact application | ‚úÖ Works | ‚úÖ Works |
| Rule grounding | ‚ùå **Same Issue** | ‚ùå **Same Issue** |
| Transitive inference | ‚ùå **Also Fails** | ‚ùå **Also Fails** |
| Query result | ‚ùå **Also Returns False** | ‚ùå **Returns False** |

### Debug Evidence from Investigation
Based on comprehensive debugging with verbose output:

**‚úÖ Rule Processing Works:**
```
Filtering rules based on queries
Rules received: 1
```

**‚úÖ Rule Body Satisfaction Works:**
```
edge clause satisfaction: True
qualified groundings: [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')]
```

**‚ùå Rule Application Fails:**
```
num applicable rules at time 0 0
num applicable EDGE rules at time 0 0
```

### Potential Root Causes
1. **Rule Grounding Logic**: `_ground_rule` function finds satisfied clauses but doesn't add to applicable rules
2. **Edge Creation Logic**: FP version may not handle edge creation for non-existent edges
3. **Satisfaction Checking**: Additional satisfaction checks may prevent rule application
4. **Head Variable Grounding**: Variables `x` and `z` may not be properly grounded to `A` and `C`

---

## 3. Investigation Results

### Debugging Steps Implemented

#### 1. Initial Analysis with Verbose Output
Created debug scripts to capture detailed reasoning process:
- Rule filtering and processing verification
- Clause satisfaction checking
- Grounding identification and validation
- Rule application decision tracking

#### 2. Comparison: Regular vs FP Behavior
**Regular Version Results:**
- ‚ùå **Also fails** to infer `connected(A, C)`
- ‚ùå **Same transitive reasoning failure** as FP version
- ‚ùå **Test would also fail** if run with regular version

**FP Version Results:**
- ‚ùå Fails to infer `connected(A, C)`
- ‚ùå Rule groundings found but not applied
- ‚ùå Query returns False for transitive connection

#### 3. Deep Dive: FP Rule Grounding Analysis

**Root Cause Identified:**
Through comprehensive debugging, the issue has been traced to **clause-to-edge matching logic** in the FP reasoning engine. The problem occurs when processing transitive rules with multiple edge clauses that share variables.

### Function Call Stack Leading to Issue:
```
pr.reason()
  ‚Üí interpretation_fp.Interpretation.reason()
    ‚Üí _ground_rule(rule, interpretations_node[t], interpretations_edge[t], ...)
      ‚Üí [for each clause in rule body]
        ‚Üí get_rule_edge_clause_grounding(clause_var_1, clause_var_2, groundings, ...)
        ‚Üí get_qualified_edge_groundings(interpretations_edge, grounding, clause_label, ...)
        ‚Üí [grounding population logic - lines 986-997]
      ‚Üí [head variable grounding - lines 1155-1156]
        ‚Üí head_var_1_groundings = groundings[head_var_1]  # Empty!
        ‚Üí head_var_2_groundings = groundings[head_var_2]  # Empty!
      ‚Üí [valid_edge_groundings loop - line 1175]
        ‚Üí for valid_e in valid_edge_groundings:  # Empty list - never executes
          ‚Üí applicable_rules_edge.append(...)  # Never reached
```

### Detailed Debugging Steps Performed:

#### 1. Initial Investigation - Rule Processing Verification
**Confirmed**: Rule filtering and processing works correctly
```bash
DEBUG output: "Rules received: 1"
DEBUG output: "num applicable EDGE rules at time 0 0"
```

#### 2. Clause Satisfaction Analysis
**Confirmed**: Individual clauses find correct groundings
```bash
edge clause satisfaction: True
qualified groundings: [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')]  # First clause
qualified groundings: [('B', 'C')]              # Second clause
```

#### 3. _ground_rule Function Deep Dive
**Added debug prints** to trace execution through rule grounding logic:
- Line 523: Added edge rule count debug output
- Lines 1205, 1320-1322: Added grounding loop debug output
- Lines 1161-1163, 1172: Added head variable grounding debug output

#### 4. Grounding Dictionary Analysis
**Discovered**: All variables present but with empty values
```bash
DEBUG: groundings dictionary keys: ['z', 'x', 'y']
DEBUG: groundings['x']: []  # Empty!
DEBUG: groundings['y']: []  # Empty!
DEBUG: groundings['z']: []  # Empty!
```

#### 5. Clause Processing Detailed Analysis
**Added debug prints** to lines 969-974, 977-978, 981, 987, 991, 996-997
**Discovered**: Clause-to-edge matching logic failure

### Critical Discovery: Clause Processing Logic Issue

**First clause** `connected(x, y)`:
- `groundings` dictionary is **empty** (no keys shown)
- So `get_rule_edge_clause_grounding` falls into **Case 1**: "Both variables have not been encountered before"
- Returns **ALL edges** that match the predicate `connected`: `[('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')]`
- **WRONG**: Should only return edges that can ground `x` and `y` for this specific clause

**Second clause** `connected(y, z)`:
- `groundings` dictionary now contains `['y', 'x']` from the first clause
- Since `y` is already grounded, should fall into **Case 3**: "source variable has been encountered before"
- Should only return edges that match the already grounded `y` values
- **Partially works**: Returns `[('B', 'C')]` but relies on corrupted first clause results

### Detailed Debugging Evidence:

**‚ùå Clause-to-Edge Matching Fails:**
```bash
First clause connected(x, y):
  DEBUG: qualified_groundings output: [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')]  ‚Üê WRONG!
  Expected: [('A', 'B')] only

Second clause connected(y, z):
  DEBUG: qualified_groundings output: [('B', 'C')]  ‚Üê Correct
```

**‚ùå Grounding Dictionary Population Corrupted:**
```bash
First clause processes both edges incorrectly:
  DEBUG: Added A to groundings['x']  ‚Üê Correct
  DEBUG: Added B to groundings['y']  ‚Üê Correct
  DEBUG: Added B to groundings['x']  ‚Üê WRONG! (from second edge)
  DEBUG: Added C to groundings['y']  ‚Üê WRONG! (from second edge)

Result: groundings['x'] = [A, B], groundings['y'] = [B, C]
Expected: groundings['x'] = [A], groundings['y'] = [B]
```

**‚ùå Head Variable Grounding Initialization Fails:**
```bash
Lines 1141-1145 logic:
  if head_var_1 not in groundings:  # x not in corrupted groundings
    groundings[head_var_1] = [head_var_1]  # groundings['x'] = ['x']
  # But head variables ARE in groundings, just empty!
  # So this initialization never happens
```

---

## 4. Deeper Issue Analysis

### Core Problem: Independent Clause Processing vs. Coordinated Grounding

The fundamental issue is that **the current approach processes each clause independently**, but **transitive reasoning requires coordinated grounding across multiple clauses**.

In a rule like `connected(x, z) <-1 connected(x, y), connected(y, z)`, the system needs to:

1. **Find all valid combinations** of edges that satisfy both clauses simultaneously
2. **Ensure variable consistency**: `y` must be the same value in both clauses (acts as the connecting variable)
3. **Coordinate edge assignment**: Each edge should only be assigned to the clause where it logically belongs

### Current Flawed Approach:
```python
# Process each clause independently
for clause in clauses:
    grounding = get_rule_edge_clause_grounding(...)  # Case 1: All edges
    qualified_groundings = get_qualified_edge_groundings(...)  # No filtering
    # Populate groundings dictionary with ALL matching edges
```

### What Should Happen:
```python
# Coordinated approach needed
1. Analyze variable dependencies between clauses (y appears in both)
2. Find valid edge combinations that maintain consistency
3. Assign each edge to appropriate clause based on variable roles
4. Ensure connecting variables have consistent values across clauses
```

### Specific Case Analysis:

**Rule**: `connected(x, z) <-1 connected(x, y), connected(y, z)`
**Facts**: `connected(A, B)`, `connected(B, C)`
**Expected**: `x=A, y=B, z=C` ‚Üí infer `connected(A, C)`

**Problem in Case 1 Logic:**
When `get_rule_edge_clause_grounding()` encounters Case 1 (both variables new), it returns **ALL** edges with the `connected` predicate. But this is wrong for transitive reasoning because:

- **First clause** `connected(x, y)` should only get edges that can serve as the "source" part of the transitive chain
- **Second clause** `connected(y, z)` should only get edges that can serve as the "target" part, with `y` matching the first clause

### Root Cause in Function Logic:

**File**: `interpretation_fp.py`, function `get_rule_edge_clause_grounding()`, lines 1471-1477:
```python
# Case 1: Both variables not encountered before
if clause_var_1 not in groundings and clause_var_2 not in groundings:
    if l in predicate_map:
        edge_groundings = predicate_map[l]  # ALL edges with predicate
    else:
        edge_groundings = edges  # ALL edges in graph
```

**Issue**: This returns ALL edges with the predicate, not considering:
1. Variable dependencies with other clauses
2. Role of variables in transitive reasoning
3. Need for coordinated grounding across clauses

---

## 5. Suggested Fixes

### Option A: Coordinated Clause Processing (Recommended)
**Approach**: Implement coordinated grounding that processes all clauses together, ensuring variable consistency.

**Implementation**:
1. **Analyze variable dependencies** between clauses before processing
2. **Implement backtracking search** to find consistent variable assignments
3. **Assign edges to clauses** based on variable roles and dependencies
4. **Validate consistency** of shared variables across clauses

**File Changes**: `interpretation_fp.py`, `_ground_rule()` function
**Complexity**: High, but addresses fundamental architectural issue

### Option B: Enhanced Case 1 Logic (Intermediate)
**Approach**: Improve `get_rule_edge_clause_grounding()` Case 1 to consider variable dependencies.

**Implementation**:
1. **Analyze other clauses** to identify shared variables
2. **Filter edge candidates** based on potential consistency requirements
3. **Apply constraint propagation** to reduce search space
4. **Maintain current architecture** with enhanced logic

**File Changes**: `interpretation_fp.py`, `get_rule_edge_clause_grounding()` function
**Complexity**: Medium, maintains existing architecture

### Option C: Post-Processing Validation (Quick Fix)
**Approach**: Allow current logic to run but add validation to filter inconsistent results.

**Implementation**:
1. **Let current logic populate** groundings dictionary
2. **Post-process results** to remove inconsistent variable assignments
3. **Filter out invalid** edge-to-clause assignments
4. **Re-populate groundings** with validated results only

**File Changes**: `interpretation_fp.py`, after grounding population (lines 1000+)
**Complexity**: Low, but may not address all edge cases

---

## 6. Critical Discovery: Both Versions Affected

### Investigation Results: Regular vs FP Comparison

**Test Setup**: Same transitive rule with both interpretation types
```python
pr.add_rule(pr.Rule('connected(x, z) <-1 connected(x, y), connected(y, z)', 'transitive_rule'))
pr.add_fact(pr.Fact('connected(A, B)', 'fact1'))
pr.add_fact(pr.Fact('connected(B, C)', 'fact2'))
```

**Demonstration Script**: [`debug_both_versions_transitive.py`](../debug_both_versions_transitive.py)
- **Purpose**: Proves both versions fail the same transitive reasoning test
- **Output**: Clear side-by-side comparison showing identical failure in both versions
- **Evidence**: Both return `connected(A, C): False` when `True` is expected

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **Facts applied correctly** in both versions: `connected(A,B)` and `connected(B,C)` return True
- ‚ùå **Transitive inference fails** in both versions: `connected(A,C)` returns False
- ‚ùå **Same root cause** affects both regular and FP reasoning engines

### Working vs Non-Working Rule Patterns

**‚úÖ Working Multi-Clause Rule** (from `test_hello_world`):
```python
'popular(x) <-1 popular(y), Friends(x,y), owns(y,z), owns(x,z)'
```
- **Pattern**: Mix of **node clauses** (`popular(y)`) and **edge clauses** (`Friends(x,y)`, etc.)
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Passes tests, correctly infers new facts

**‚ùå Non-Working All-Edge Rule** (our transitive rule):
```python
'connected(x, z) <-1 connected(x, y), connected(y, z)'
```
- **Pattern**: **All edge clauses** (`connected(x, y)`, `connected(y, z)`)
- **Result**: ‚ùå Fails in both regular and FP versions

### Hypothesis: Node Anchoring Required

The evidence suggests that **PyReason requires node clauses as anchors** for proper variable grounding in multi-clause rules. Pure edge-to-edge transitive reasoning may not be supported in the current implementation.

**Supporting Evidence**:
1. All working multi-clause rules in test suite have node clause anchors
2. Pure edge-to-edge transitive rule fails in both interpretation types
3. Grounding logic appears optimized for node-anchored variable resolution

- Identify systematic differences from regular version
- Implement unified rule application logic

### Phase 4: Validation üß™
1. **Test Transitive Reasoning**: Verify fix resolves the specific test case
2. **Test Other Rule Types**: Ensure fix doesn't break other reasoning patterns
3. **Performance Validation**: Verify no impact on FP reasoning performance

---

## 6. Alternative Solutions

### Short-term: Skip FP Transitive Tests ‚ö†Ô∏è
```python
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="FP transitive reasoning under investigation")
def test_basic_reasoning_fp():
    pass
```
**Risk**: Reduces test coverage, doesn't address core reasoning issue

### Medium-term: Document FP Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
Add documentation noting FP version limitations with transitive reasoning
**Risk**: Accepts functional limitation, reduces FP version utility

### Long-term: Fix FP Rule Grounding ‚úÖ
Investigate and fix the underlying rule grounding and application issue
**Recommended**: Addresses root cause, maintains API consistency

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Numba Compilation Constraints
- **Challenge**: FP code uses `@numba.njit` decorators limiting debugging
- **Impact**: Reduced visibility into rule grounding execution
- **Solution**: Use print statements and careful analysis of data structures

### Rule Grounding Complexity
- **Concern**: Complex interaction between variable binding and rule application
- **Mitigation**: Systematic debugging of each grounding step
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test cases for various rule patterns

### Performance Implications
- **Requirement**: Fix must not impact FP reasoning performance
- **Challenge**: Rule grounding is performance-critical path
- **Solution**: Optimize fixes to maintain numba compilation benefits

---

## 8. Impact Analysis

### üìã Affected Components
- FP rule grounding logic (`_ground_rule` function)
- Edge rule application in FP reasoning engine
- Transitive reasoning capabilities
- Basic logical inference patterns

### üö´ NOT Affected (until fix)
- Fact application in FP version
- Simple rule application (non-transitive)
- Regular interpretation reasoning
- FP reasoning for other rule types (pending verification)

### üîÑ Backwards Compatibility
**‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENTLY BROKEN**
- FP version lacks reasoning capabilities available in regular version
- API promises logical inference but doesn't deliver consistently
- Fix required to restore intended functionality

---

## 9. Success Criteria

### Minimum Requirements ‚úÖ
1. `test_basic_reasoning_fp` passes without modification
2. FP version successfully infers `connected(A, C)` from transitive rule
3. Query `interpretation.query(pr.Query('connected(A, C)'))` returns True

### Optimal Requirements ‚úÖ
1. FP and regular versions produce identical results for transitive reasoning
2. No performance degradation in FP reasoning after fix
3. All logical inference patterns work consistently in FP version

### Validation Tests ‚úÖ
1. Transitive reasoning test passes for both interpretation types
2. Other rule types continue to work in FP version
3. Performance benchmarks show acceptable fix overhead

---

## 10. Conclusion

This issue represents a **critical gap in FP reasoning engine's logical inference capabilities**. The failure of basic transitive reasoning undermines the reliability and completeness of the FP version, making it unsuitable for applications requiring sound logical inference.

The investigation has pinpointed the issue to the rule grounding logic in `_ground_rule` function, where satisfied rule conditions are not being converted into applicable rules. This is a **precision issue** rather than a fundamental design flaw, making it likely fixable with targeted debugging and correction.

### üéØ Recommendation: **TEST MODIFICATION REQUIRED** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status Change**: Issue is **not FP-specific** - affects fundamental PyReason architecture

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Remove or modify test** `test_basic_reasoning_fp` as it tests unsupported functionality
2. **Update test to use node-anchored pattern** if transitive reasoning is needed
3. **Document limitation** in PyReason: pure edge-to-edge transitive rules not supported

**Alternative Test Pattern** (if transitive reasoning needed):
```python
# Instead of: connected(x, z) <-1 connected(x, y), connected(y, z)
# Use node-anchored pattern:
pr.add_rule(pr.Rule('reachable(x, z) <-1 node(x), connected(x, y), connected(y, z), node(z)', 'transitive_rule'))
```

**Priority**: **Medium** - Not a critical bug but test suite cleanup needed

**Long-term Consideration**: If pure edge-to-edge transitive reasoning is desired, this would require significant architectural changes to both regular and FP reasoning engines.
