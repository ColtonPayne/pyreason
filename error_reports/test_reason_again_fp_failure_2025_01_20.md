# PyReason Functional Test Failure - Error Report

**Date:** January 20, 2025
**Issue:** KeyError in `test_reason_again_fp` functional test
**Severity:** High (blocks FP reasoning continuation functionality)
**Status:** üîç ANALYZED - Investigation Required

---

## 1. Test Failure Analysis

### Test Case
```
tests/functional/test_reason_again.py::test_reason_again_fp
```

### Failure Symptoms
- ‚ùå Test **fails** with `KeyError` when accessing dataframes
- ‚úÖ Regular test `test_reason_again()` **passes** without FP version enabled
- Error likely occurs when accessing `dataframes[2]`, `dataframes[3]`, or `dataframes[4]` (lines 96-98)
- Suggests FP version doesn't properly handle reasoning continuation

### Error Details
```
KeyError
File "tests/functional/test_reason_again.py", line 96-98, in test_reason_again_fp
    assert len(dataframes[2]) == 1, 'At t=0 there should be one popular person'
    assert len(dataframes[3]) == 2, 'At t=1 there should be two popular people'
    assert len(dataframes[4]) == 3, 'At t=2 there should be three popular people'
```

### Root Cause Investigation
- Test performs two-phase reasoning: initial reasoning, then "reason again" with additional facts
- FP version may not properly handle `pr.reason(timesteps=3, again=True, restart=False)`
- The `dataframes` list likely doesn't contain expected timesteps, causing KeyError on index access

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The problem stems from FP interpretation class not properly handling reasoning continuation:

### Test Logic Flow
```python
# Phase 1: Initial reasoning
interpretation = pr.reason(timesteps=1)

# Phase 2: Add new fact and continue reasoning
new_fact = pr.Fact('popular(Mary)', 'popular_fact2', 2, 4)
pr.add_fact(new_fact)
interpretation = pr.reason(timesteps=3, again=True, restart=False)

# Verification: Expects timesteps 0-4 to exist
dataframes = pr.filter_and_sort_nodes(interpretation, ['popular'])
assert len(dataframes[2]) == 1  # ‚Üê KeyError likely here
```

### Reasoning Timeline Expected
| Phase | Timesteps | Facts | Expected Result |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Initial | 0-1 | `popular(Mary)` [0,1] | Basic reasoning |
| Continue | 2-3 | + `popular(Mary)` [2,4] | Extended reasoning without restart |
| Final | 0-4 | Combined facts | Full timeline accessible |

### Comparison with Regular Version
| Component | Regular Interpretation | FP Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Initial reasoning | ‚úÖ Works | ‚úÖ Works |
| Reason again | ‚úÖ Works | ‚ùå **Issue** |
| Timeline continuity | ‚úÖ Maintains | ‚ùå **Broken** |
| Dataframe access | ‚úÖ All timesteps | ‚ùå **Missing timesteps** |

### Potential Root Causes
1. **Timeline Management**: FP version may not properly merge reasoning phases
2. **State Persistence**: Previous reasoning state may not be preserved
3. **Timestep Indexing**: FP version may use different timestep numbering
4. **Memory Structure**: FP interpretations may organize temporal data differently

---

## 3. Investigation Required

### Areas to Examine

#### 1. FP Reasoning Continuation Logic
**File:** `pyreason/scripts/interpretation/interpretation_fp.py`
**Method:** `start_fp(...)` with `again=True, restart=False`

```python
# Check how FP version handles reasoning continuation
def start_fp(self, tmax, facts_node, facts_edge, rules, verbose,
             convergence_threshold, convergence_bound_threshold,
             again=False, restart=True):
    # Investigation needed: How does again=True work?
    # Does it preserve previous timestep data?
```

#### 2. Timestep Data Structure
**Investigation:** How FP version stores and accesses multi-timestep data

```python
# Check data structures in FP interpretation
self.interpretations_node[t]  # Does this support full timeline?
self.interpretations_edge[t]  # Are all timesteps preserved?
```

#### 3. filter_and_sort_nodes Compatibility
**File:** `pyreason/pyreason.py`
**Method:** `filter_and_sort_nodes(interpretation, ['popular'])`

```python
# Investigation: Does this function work correctly with FP interpretations?
# Does it expect specific data structures that FP version doesn't provide?
```

### Debugging Steps Required

1. **Add Debug Output**:
   ```python
   interpretation = pr.reason(timesteps=3, again=True, restart=False)
   print(f"Available timesteps: {list(range(interpretation.time + 1))}")
   print(f"Interpretation type: {type(interpretation)}")

   dataframes = pr.filter_and_sort_nodes(interpretation, ['popular'])
   print(f"Dataframes length: {len(dataframes)}")
   print(f"Available indices: {list(range(len(dataframes)))}")
   ```

2. **Compare Data Structures**:
   ```python
   # Regular version
   pr.settings.fp_version = False
   regular_interp = pr.reason(timesteps=3, again=True, restart=False)

   # FP version
   pr.settings.fp_version = True
   fp_interp = pr.reason(timesteps=3, again=True, restart=False)

   # Compare structures
   compare_interpretations(regular_interp, fp_interp)
   ```

3. **Timeline Verification**:
   ```python
   # Check if all expected timesteps exist
   for t in range(5):  # 0-4
       try:
           result = interpretation.query(pr.Query('popular(Mary)'), t=t)
           print(f"T={t}: {result}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"T={t}: ERROR - {e}")
   ```
